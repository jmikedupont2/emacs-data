* Introduction
This is the Emacs Data Repository, a collection of data files obtained from both runtime and compile-time analysis of Emacs. It serves the purpose of understanding Emacs's behavior and performance.

* Project Structure
The repository employs Git submodules for modularity. Each submodule in the "vendors" section hosts various tools and modules that contribute to the project's goals.

** Emacspeak
This section contains samples and profiles obtained during the analysis of the Emacspeak process.

* Learning Journey
As part of my learning process, I'm using Org mode to document the development and analysis of this repository. Org mode's flexibility and features make it an excellent choice for this purpose.

* Best Practices
To ensure content is easily addressable within Git, we follow best practices:

1. Keep files small: This aids in version control and collaboration.

2. Piecing content together: Org mode, in combination with Pandoc, offers an effective method to assemble and organize the collected data and insights.

* Conclusion
This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in Emacs introspection and analysis. Feel free to explore the various sections and submodules to gain insights into Emacs's runtime behavior.
